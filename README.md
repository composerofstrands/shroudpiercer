# Shroudpiercer

**Shroudpiercer** is a Stellaris companion desktop app that reveals the real tech deck.

Stellaris uses a weighted draw system for technologies — and while you can influence the weights through empire setup and research order, the game never shows you the exact pool or chances.

Shroudpiercer calculates them.

---

## Features (Alpha)

- configure empire setup (ethics, civics, origin, researched techs)
- see *all* currently eligible technologies
- see actual effective draw weights & probabilities
- mark techs as researched to update the pool in real-time

### Why this matters

Planning your tech path becomes an actual skill, not guesswork.

---

## Status

Public Alpha release planned: **December 2nd, 2025**

Currently updating for the November 25th Stellaris species pack patch.

---

## Roadmap (post-Alpha)

- Interactive tech tree
- Empire designer
- Build planner (traditions, ascension perks, etc.)
- Leader trait analyser
- Economy efficiency analyser
